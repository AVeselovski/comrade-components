# COMRADE-COMPONENTS-REACT

## What is?

React components library. Extension of `comrade-styles`. Somewhat influenced by Bootstarp 4, somewhat by Material UI. This is a **WIP** project of mine, please ignore.

## Why is?

Mainly it's fun to have your own custom tailored CSS and over-complicated React components at your disposal. Eventually, to save time "bootstrapping" new projects UI.

## Installation

`yarn add comrade-components`

**Advised:**

`yarn add styled-system @styled-system/theme-get`

## Usage

TODO...

## Development

0. Pull and `yarn`
1. Make sure local development `comrade-styles` is linked (`yarn link comrade-styles`)
2. Do stuff

If working on development / feature branch:

3. Commit & push
4. To deploy to Vercel development environment (aka "preview"), run `vercel`

If publishing:

3. Commit
4. Update version (`npm version major|minor|patch`)
5. Push with tags (`git push --tags origin master`)

   - Vercel will deploy to production and development environments automatically

6. Publish (`npm publish`)
