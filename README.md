# COMRADE-COMPONENTS

## What is?

React components library. Continuation of `comrade-styles`. Somewhat influenced by Bootstarp 4, somewhat by Material UI. This is a **WIP** project of mine, please ignore.

## Why is?

Mainly it's fun to have your own custom tailored CSS and over-complicated React components at your disposal. Eventually, to save time "bootstrapping" new projects UI.

## Installation

`yarn add comrade-components`

**Advised:**

`yarn add styled-system @styled-system/theme-get`

## Usage

TODO...
